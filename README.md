# NUTS_CMB_separation
Hierarchical Bayesian CMB component separation with the No-U-Turn Sampler. The method/algorithm is described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14170.

Note - This is still under heavy development, and has mainly been tested on the Oxford Glamdring cluster. These are just the core scripts. A large amount of associated data (used in running/testing) is stored on the cluster.
